    Parameters
    ----------
    x : list or np.array
        The channel values where the gaussian is made, must cover all peaks.
    *args : list or np.array
        The parameters for the gaussians, must be in the order:

    """
    Fits n peaks to n gaussians, given an array and the guessed centers.
    Returns the fitted param [[amp, peak, std], covar].

    Uses curve_fit from scipy.optimize. This is a non-linear least squares,
    which means that it tries to find the parameters that minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals.
    The residuals are the difference between the data and the model.
    The model is the sum of the gaussians, and the parameters are the amplitudes, means and standard deviations of the gaussians.

    guess_wid : int, optional

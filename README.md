# Exploring EDS data from the SEM Apreo at NanoLab

Code for TFY4520 - Nanotechnology, Specialization Project (Prosjektoppgaven).

Doing signal processing of EDS spectra in python/Jupyter notebooks.

Goal: Making useful contributions to [Hyperspy](https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy "HyperSpy") for calibrations of EDS sensors in SEMs and/or a module for signal processing.

Borrowed code:

- export_eds_maps.py is from [Daniel Lundebys master thesis](https://github.com/dmlundeby/master-thesis-code "Improving the accuracy of TEM-EDX quantification by implementing the Î¶-factor method")
